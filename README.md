# The Lab

## Welcome to The Lab!

In the lab we do two things:

* __Brief instructor led discussions__: These could be talking through a programming concept or demoing a technique.  During these sessions it is expected that all in attendance will be engaged in the discussion.

* __Project work__: This will be the bulk of the time. Each member will be required to be actively working on a project. *Some* of their time can be spent learning new techniques by following tutorials which the mentors can recommend, but it is expected that some amount of progress will be made each week on the member's own project.  Member's can team up and work on a project together, but in this case, each memeber must make some contribution to the project's completion each week.

## Project Types

### Professional(ish) Video Games

If you want to make a real game that you can play on your computer, phone, or home or handheld game console, then the most likely tool is going to be Unity. You can make 2D and 3D games of any style from Space Invaders up to Fortnite. There are loads of free learning resources available, and we can help you along the way.

### Casual + Web Based Games

If you want to just do something quick and simple, then you can use Phaser for a browser based game.  Game Maker and Roblox are other options, but these are only stepping stones. You should be moving on to a "real" coding experience as quickly as possible. You won't be able to publish your games here, but you'll have some fun learning some new skills.

### Applications

Got an idea for a phone app that may be useful? Lots of options to making these. Let's hear your idea, and we'll figure out a plan using the right tools for the job.

### Electronics + Robotics

This is going to be a challenge to do remotely, but if you can get the parts yourself, we can walk through things or provide support over our weekly video conferences.

### Web Pages

Want do make a website for your school, club, family, project, fan site?  Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and get your site published. 

### Other Project Types

This is *your* club, and we want to make it open to any type of coding and electronics projects. If there is something specific you'd like to work on, just talk to one of the mentors and we'll see what we can do to make that happen.
